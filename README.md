### Python Project:
# Video Streaming Services

This project is the final project of Pacmann's **Basic Python Programming** course. In this project I was asked to create a simple program for the video streaming platform PacFlix. There are 3 plans in PacFlix, namely Basic Plan, Standard Plan and Premium Plan. Each plan has different benefits and prices as shown below:

## Objective
Create a feature where users can do the following
1. Review all plans available in PacFlix
2. Check the plans used by **existing users**.
3. **Current user**: Can upgrade plan from current plan if **plan duration > 12 months** will get a discount
4. **New user**: Can sign up and get a discount if you use **referral code**.

## Discount
There are 2 conditions to get a discount for current users and new users:
1. Users who have a duration plan > 12 months and want to upgrade the plan will get a 5% discount.
2. If a new user who wants to subscribe has a referral code and matches the data in the database, the payment will be valid and will get a 4% discount.
